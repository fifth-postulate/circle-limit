# Circle Limit
An [hyperbolic plane][wikipedia:hyperbolic-plane] exploration of [Functional Geometry][paper:functional-geometry].

## Origin Story
At [Booster Conf 2023][conference:booster.2023] [Einar W. HÃ¸st][twitter:einarwh] presented the workshop [_The Escher school of Fish_][github:einarwh.workshop].

This workshop presents the ideas of Peter Hendersons [revised 2002 paper][paper:functional-geometry] _Functional Geometry_ by guiding participants through a JavaScript implementation.

During the Q&A it was mentioned that [_Circle Limit III_][wikipedia:circle-limit-III], another work by Escher, is not as easily adapted to the same drawing primitives.

I interjected that the ideas are still applicable, only that the underlying geometry is different.

After a quick consultation, we agreed to challenge ourselves and try to apply Hendersons ideas and create a workshop to reproduce Circle Limit III.
