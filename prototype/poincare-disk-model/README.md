# Poincare Disk Model
The [Poincare disk model][wikipedia:poincare-disk-model] of the hyperbolic geometry is

> a model of 2-dimensional hyperbolic geometry in which all points are inside the unit disk, and straight lines are either circular arcs contained within the disk that are orthogonal to the unit circle or diameters of the unit circle.

In this prototype we will explore geometric constuctions in this model.
